## Year III Semester VI Paper - COMPUTER GRAPHICS

This is my code for the core paper Computer Graphics((BHCS14) I completed during my BSc. (Hons.) Computer Science undergraduate degree from Delhi University in batch 2019-2022.

## List of aim for the programs

1. Write a program to implement Bresenhamâ€™s line drawing algorithm.
2. Write a program to implement mid-point circle drawing algorithm.
3. Write a program to clip a line using Cohen and Sutherland line clipping algorithm.
4. Write a program to clip a polygon using Sutherland Hodgeman algorithm.
5. Write a program to fill a polygon using Scan line fill algorithm.
6. Write a program to apply various 2D transformations on a 2D object (use homogenous Coordinates).
7. Write a program to apply various 3D transformations on a 3D object and then apply parallel and perspective projection on it.
8. Write a program to draw Hermite /Bezier curve.
